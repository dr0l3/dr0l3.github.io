title: Busdriver software
---

I had an interesting encounter with a busdriver today. He was fairly annoyed with the software responsible for updating the signs with destinations and route numbers. The software system was supposed to update the signs automatically, but had failed to do so. The driver then had to manually update the signs. 

Something about software only working some of the time

Busdriver quote: "We buy this COTS software and boy do we want it to be cheap. Then we want to build all sorts of things up top if it. Things it was not designed to do. Oh and ofcourse we expect it to work"

If only the senior officials in charge of software acquisitions were this observant.
