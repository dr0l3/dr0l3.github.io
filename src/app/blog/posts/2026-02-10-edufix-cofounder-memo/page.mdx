# Cofounder memo

This is a long-term intervention in a system that is failing in plain sight.

I’m building education infrastructure because **the current system is structurally under-optimized**. Incremental fixes (and technical revolutions like the internet) have not moved the needle in 25 years. If that statement sparks curiosity or frustration we should talk.

This memo is somewhat harsh and direct (I have an empathic side as well). It’s meant to find the one or two people who already see the problem and want to engage.

## The problem is physics.

Classrooms still run on a factory model:

- children are grouped by age
- classes move at roughly the same pace
- we check quality at the end

Translated to any other domain—say weightlifting—it has obvious flaws. People have different starting points and learning rates. Too much load and they fail or get injured. Too little and there is no adaptive response or they disengage.

So the job becomes *calibrating the load per student*. Differentiation.

Now do the math: in a class of 20, a teacher has at best **~3 minutes per student per hour**, while also running the room.

In those three minutes we implicitly expect them to:

* assess where the student actually is
* diagnose if/*why* they’re stuck
* choose and start an intervention
* verify whether it worked

With today’s tools, this simply does not happen. This isn’t about teacher quality or motivation. The problem is simply absurd.

Also; teachers have at most 2 eyes.

## The browser is the digital classroom—and it’s uncontrolled

The physical classroom is insulated. We don’t teach in the middle of a town square.

Digitally, we do exactly that.

Most digital schoolwork now happens in the browser—the most distraction-dense environment we’ve ever built. Notifications, games, social feeds, shopping, shortcuts, and now high-quality AI outputs are always one or two clicks away and trivially blended with “real work.”

After interviewing 70+ teachers across the Nordics and Estonia, the pattern is consistent:

- teachers feel they’ve lost control
- many respond by retreating to analog
- bans start to replace pedagogy because there’s no better option

This is both sad and predictable. The infrastructure is lacking.

## Why apps, policies, and “just add AI” don’t fix this

We’ve had decades of educational apps, platforms, and tools. Some are good locally. None have shifted system-level outcomes.

The reason is simple: **learning doesn’t happen inside one app**.

Students read, write, research, explore, get stuck, try again, switch contexts. The moment activity leaves the app, the signal disappears. An app does not help with this. We leave the calibration problem to the teacher. Those 3 minutes disappear quickly.

Policies don’t change physics.
AI distributed via an open browser from companies with questionable incentives makes the control and integrity problem worse, not better.

So the claims here are:

> We need digital education


> If you want digital education to **really** work, you need infrastructure first.

## The wedge: a real digital classroom

The first product is a **teacher-controlled browser**:

- it can take over the device (like exam browsers already do)
- it’s trivial for teachers to configure
- it allows what should be allowed and blocks what shouldn’t—by default

This solves an immediate, painful problem: **focus and integrity during learning time**.

More importantly, it creates the platform we need. It gives us the ability to record **learning journeys**. It gives us more eyes.

## The long game: shift from outputs to process

If “three minutes per student” is ever going to be enough, teachers need leverage.

That leverage comes from shifting evaluation and feedback:

- not just *what* students produced
- but *how* they worked

Initially, this is for humans. Teachers should be able to review not only the final artifact, but the path:

- what was read
- what was tried
- where the student struggled
- how tools (including AI) were used

Over time, those journeys become structured signals. At scale, patterns emerge:

- good sequences and ineffective sequences
- common misconceptions and how to address them
- interventions that reliably work for certain profiles

That’s where improvement starts to compound.

In software, progress compounds because work leaves behind durable resuable artifacts (code).
In teaching, much of the craft lives in people’s heads and folders—and evaporates when they leave.

The goal is to build infrastructure that lets good teaching **persist, propagate, and improve**.

The above is somewhat vague, but a proper description would be way too long. Ask me.

## Why this can scale

This is a global problem, or will increasingly become with AI, but the wedge is especially strong in environments like the EU:

- widespread device use (often BYOD)
- limited institutional control
- shared browser-centric workflows

The surface area is universal:

- most digital learning flows through the browser
- browsers cross borders
- the internet is shared

If it works, it scales.

## My commitment

I have two small children who are about to enter an education system that looks uncomfortably similar to the one I went through. If that's not changed I consider that a failure of our generation.

I don’t believe in small, local optimizations that make us feel busy while outcomes stay flat. If the structural base is broken, you fix the structure.

I’m explicitly targeting **large, measurable outcome shifts**. If, in ten years, system-level indicators like PISA scores haven’t moved meaningfully—more *hundreds* than tens—we’re not doing the right work.

## What exists already

- 70+ in-depth teacher interviews, with consistent patterns
- A working technical foundation
- An initial teacher-controlled browser focused on attention and control ([see for yourself](https://stillwell.io))
- Active testing with real classroom use

I own the technical implementation end-to-end.

## What I’m looking for in a cofounder

The ying to my yang. I enjoy "the people side" in medium to low dosages and tech in high dosages.

Specifically, someone who:

- has a growth mindset and a high pain threshold (i am sure we will have lots of fun as well)
- is tech and ai literate
- understands schools as human systems, not just customers
- is energized by slow, trust-based progress
- wants to own adoption, pilots, pricing, procurement, and relationships
- is willing to repeat the same hard conversations across schools, regions, and countries

This is not a sales role in the traditional sense. It’s ownership of the human side of a system change.

If you read this and felt relief rather than skepticism; I’m building this, lets talk.
