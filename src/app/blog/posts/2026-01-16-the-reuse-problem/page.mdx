# The reuse problem

<SeriesBlock current="2026-01-16-the-reuse-problem" />

In the last posts I’ve been circling the same constraint from different angles.

- If the “weight” is wrong, students drift. ([The attention and motivation problem](/blog/posts/2026-01-10-the-attention-problem).)
- If difficulty ramps on a schedule for a whole cohort, calibration breaks. ([Education as weightlifting](/blog/posts/2026-01-07-weight-education).)
- If you take calibration seriously, you immediately hit a measurement and time bottleneck. ([The learning rate problem](/blog/posts/2026-01-08-the-learning-rate-problem).)

This post is about the piece that makes the bottleneck feel *permanent* in today’s system: **we don’t reuse teaching solutions at scale**, so we don’t compound.

## The physics: three minutes per student

Take a simple, generous model.

- A class has 20 students.
- You have 60 minutes.

That’s **three minutes per student** if you could spend the whole hour on one-on-one calibration.

But you can’t. You’re also teaching the whole group, keeping the room stable, handling transitions, answering questions, redirecting attention, dealing with devices, checking understanding, and doing a hundred small things that keep learning from collapsing.

So the “three minutes” is already best case.

And what are we implicitly asking a teacher to do in that time?

- **Diagnose**: Is the student stuck because the work is too hard, too easy, unclear, unread, boring, socially risky, missing prerequisites, or built on a misconception?
- **Choose an intervention**: What should happen *next* for this student, *right now*?
- **Verify**: Did it work, or did we just produce compliance?

If you believe calibration is central, this is the brutal reality: **the job is intractable unless the system does more of the work.**

## Teachers build a “drawer” (and then guard it)

There’s a pattern I keep noticing in how teachers talk about their practice.

In the beginning, you don’t have much. You’re building what I used to call the *drawer*: lesson plans, exercises, explanations that work, routines that keep the room functioning, and all the little interventions you can reach for when students get stuck.

That drawer takes years to build.

And because building it is hard, most of the improvements are local:

- you tweak an exercise after a bad lesson
- you rewrite an explanation after a confused class
- you learn, slowly, what tends to work for which students

But the loop is too small. You might run the same lesson a handful of times per year. Maybe you share it with a colleague. Maybe not.

Which means we’ve designed a system where **thousands of teachers teach the same topics to the same age groups—and mostly improve in isolation.** Many of them largely duplicating each others work.

## Software got good by compounding reuse

I come from software engineering, and it’s hard not to see the contrast.

Software didn’t improve mainly because programmers became morally better people. It improved because we built a culture and infrastructure where reuse is the default:

- you assume someone has solved parts of your problem before
- you search for the best existing solution
- you integrate it, rather than rebuilding it
- and over time, those shared solutions get sharpened by thousands of real uses

The mechanism is not mysterious. It’s just compounding.

And importantly, trust is practical. When engineers choose a library, they rarely read all the code. They use proxy signals:

- is it widely used?
- who is using it?
- is it actively maintained?
- does it have good docs and clear examples?

Those signals work because the ecosystem is built around the idea that a small number of shared components can serve a huge number of people.

## The reuse question in education

So here’s the uncomfortable question:

**Why is it normal that every teacher has to build their own drawer, from scratch, for problems that are extremely common?**

I don’t mean “a national curriculum” or “a single approved textbook.” Autonomy matters, and the goal isn’t to standardize teaching into one style.

I mean something narrower:

> If 10,000 teachers teach the same topic this year, why don’t we get 10,000× better materials out the other end?

Right now we mostly don’t. We get 10,000 parallel attempts, and the improvements largely disappear into individual classrooms. The system of education is not compounding.

## What does “reuse” actually mean here?

Reuse in education shouldn’t be “download a PDF and hope.”

If it’s going to help with the three-minute constraint, it has to be closer to a *toolbox of interventions* that gets better through use.

In practice, that means something like:

- **Small, composable units**: explanations, exercises, scaffolds, hints, examples, checks for understanding, “if they make this mistake, do this next.”
- **Clear entry conditions**: what misconception or prerequisite gap is this targeting?
- **Observable outcomes**: what should change if it worked?
- **Iteration**: a way for teachers (and researchers) to improve the unit over time without rewriting the whole curriculum.
- **Trust signals**: “used by many,” “works for these contexts,” “maintained by these people.”

That last one matters more than it sounds. Reuse doesn’t scale unless teachers can quickly answer: *should I trust this?*

## Not everyone has to contribute

In software, most people don’t write widely reused libraries.

A small fraction builds shared components; the majority reuse them. That’s fine. The ecosystem still compounds because the shared components become leverage for everyone else.

Education can work the same way:

- most teachers should be able to **teach well without becoming content authors**
- a smaller group will naturally become **high-leverage contributors**
- schools (and companies) can become **maintainers**, not just consumers

## Incentives exist (we just don’t capture them)

“Why would anyone contribute?” is a natural first objection.

In software, the answer is often status and career leverage: authorship is a signal of competence. Companies contribute because it helps hiring and reputation.

Education has analogues:

- a teacher who authors a widely used module has real professional reputation
- a school that maintains high-quality open materials signals seriousness and attracts talent
- networks of teachers can share maintenance work instead of each rebuilding the same thing alone

The problem is not that incentives are impossible. The problem is that we haven’t built the rails that let contribution turn into compounding reuse.

We are lacking what GitHub and package managers like npm has done for software.

## The missing ingredient: a feedback loop

There’s one more problem hiding under all of this.

For reuse to work, we need to know whether something *actually helped*—and for whom.

In the [learning rate post](/blog/posts/2026-01-08-the-learning-rate-problem), I argued that continuous calibration likely requires an instrumented environment, because you need more observations than a teacher can get by walking around the room.

Reuse has the same requirement.

If a lesson unit is going to improve over time, you want a feedback loop that can answer:

- where do students reliably get stuck?
- what mistakes cluster together (hinting at a specific misconception)?
- which scaffolds reduce time-to-mastery for which students?
- does this intervention improve learning, or just reduce visible struggle?

Without some instrumentation, “iteration” becomes vibes and anecdotes.

With instrumentation, iteration can become closer to engineering: not perfect, not purely quantitative, but anchored in real usage data and real learning outcomes.

## What would a compounding classroom feel like?

If we ever want “three minutes per student” to be enough, the teacher needs leverage.

My current picture is simple:

- the classroom runs inside a bounded digital environment (a browser is the obvious substrate)
- teaching units live in a shared library that teachers can pull from, adapt, and improve
- the system captures the minimal signals needed to see where students struggle and what helped
- over time, the best interventions get better, and the average teacher starts with a much stronger drawer than today

That’s what I mean by the reuse problem.

Right now, teaching knowledge is often trapped inside individual heads and individual folders.
After 30 years, a teacher retires—and much of that accumulated craft evaporates.

In software, work sticks around. It keeps serving people. It keeps getting improved.

If education is going to become a system that compounds, we need the same property: **the ability to preserve and reuse what works, at scale, and to keep making it better.**
